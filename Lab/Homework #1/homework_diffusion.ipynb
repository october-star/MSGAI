        "# Homework - Performance Evaluation of Diffusion models\n",
        "In this homework, you will conduct a performance comparison between two popular diffusion models: Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models ([DDPM](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.11239)) and Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models ([DDIM](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.02502)). Your task is to evaluate and compare the efficacy of these models in generating high-quality synthetic data, focusing on aspects such as image quality, computational efficiency, and training stability. You will implement both models, apply them to a common dataset, and analyze their performance using metrics like FID (FrÃ©chet Inception Distance). The goal is to understand the strengths and weaknesses of DDPM and DDIM, providing insights into how their differing approaches to diffusion and denoising affect overall model performance.\n",

For each configuration, you will conduct multiple runs with different number of steps, analyzing how the number of steps affects image quality (3 points) and computational efficiency (3 points). By comparing the results, you will gain insights (1 points) into the trade-offs between the number of steps, image quality, and processing time, thus understanding the balance for effective diffusion model performance.
